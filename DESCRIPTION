Description: Programmatic interface to several NASA Earth Observation 'OPeNDAP' servers (Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol) (<https://www.opendap.org/>). Allows for easy downloads of MODIS subsets, as well as other Earth Observation datacubes, in a time-saving and efficient way : by sampling it at the very downloading phase (spatially, temporally and dimensionally).
